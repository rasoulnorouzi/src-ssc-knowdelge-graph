<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Projection</head><p><s>In the PD, players' estimates of the other player's choice typically are collected after the player has indicated his or her own choice.</s><s>The evidence shows that cooperators expect more cooperation than defectors do, and estimates are more accurate than they would be if players claimed to be agnostic about their opponents' behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dawes, McTavish, &amp; Shaklee, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kelley &amp; Stahelski, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr">Messe &amp; Sivacek, 1979)</ref>.</s><s>Because these estimates are postdictions, they say little about the way in which projection can shape players' own decisions.</s><s>In contrast, evidential reasoning suggests that antecedent projection (i.e., anchoring predictions of an opponent's choice on one's own intended choice) increases the willingness to cooperate.</s></p><p><s>On the surface, there is a difference between the postdiction and the prediction paradigm.</s><s>In the postdiction paradigm, the cooperators and the defectors who make the estimates about others are different players.</s><s>In the prediction paradigm, the same player is thought to make two conditional judgments before reaching a final decision.</s><s>The player may ask, "What is the probability that my opponent will cooperate if I cooperate?"</s><s>and "What is the probability that my opponent will cooperate if I defect?"</s></p><p><s>The distinction between postdiction and prediction has no statistical implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Krueger &amp; Acevedo, 2005b</ref>).</s><s>If it is rational for two players with different preferences to make different predictions about the majority response, it is also rational for the same player to make different predictions when his or her own intended response changes.</s><s>For example, when participants' own responses are manipulated by experimental design, their social predictions change accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clement &amp; Krueger, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The model of evidential reasoning assumes that similar changes occur (indeed, should occur) when a person merely considers alternative behavioral options.</s><s>In the PD, a player needs to contemplate the implications of own cooperation and own defection before committing to one of these choices.</s><s>Therefore, opponent cooperation should appear more probable when own cooperation is being considered than when own defection is being considered.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kay and Ross (2003)</ref>  The dominance principle does not provide an answer because it mandates defection as long as the inequality of payoffs that defines the PD is satisfied.</s><s>However, evidential reasoning does predict the effect of the K ratio.</s><s>For a given expectation of reciprocity, a higher K ratio is more likely to yield EV(c) &gt; EV(d).</s><s>Thus, we hypothesize that a high K ratio elicits more cooperation than a low K ratio (Experiment 1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assimilation</head><p><s>The alternative to the projection hypothesis is the idea that choices reflect players' efforts to reciprocate what they perceive to be the opponent's most probable choice.</s><s>In its elementary form, the assimilation hypothesis states that cooperation increases with the perceived probability of opponent cooperation.</s><s>Two lines of reasoning suggest that this might be so.</s><s>First, the norm of reciprocity demands that people treat others the way they themselves have been treated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>.</s><s>The norm of reciprocity makes cooperation the moral choice when opponent cooperation is evident or at least suspected.</s><s>Second, assimilation is a successful strategy in repeated social dilemmas because it shapes the ongoing behaviors toward the optimum collective outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rapoport, 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Although a strategy of reciprocity can be used only in a repeated PD, some players may generalize its effectiveness to one-shot dilemmas.</s><s>As a result, they may assimilate their own behavior to what they think their opponent will do.</s></p><p><s>In the present experiments, we directly manipulated players' expectations of the probability with which the opponent would reciprocate their choice (Experiment 1) and the probability with which the opponent would cooperate (Experiment 2).</s><s>The probability of reciprocity was a proxy for the psychological process of projection, and the probability of cooperation was a proxy for a stable assumption (i.e., stereotype) about what another person would choose to do.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability of reciprocity</head><p><s>The two main hypotheses that motivated this study were that rates of cooperation would increase with the probability of reciprocity and with the K ratio of the payoff matrix.</s><s>The findings supported both hypotheses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>Rates of cooperation were low when there were no expectations of reciprocity (23%), moderate for intermediate expectations (66%), and high for high expectations (93%).</s><s>A pair of Wilcoxon's tests for matched samples confirmed that the moderate rate of cooperation was significantly higher than the low rate, z = 6.63, p &lt; .001,</s><s>and significantly lower than the high rate, z = 5.17, p &lt; .001.</s><s>This rise of cooperation across levels of expected reciprocity was observed for each individual matrix, McNemar's Q(2) = 63.51 for K= .17,</s><s>81.34 for K= .5, and 77.23 for K= .83,</s><s>all ps &lt; .01.</s><s>Also as expected, rates of cooperation increased with the Kratio of the payoffs, but this effect was limited to the intermediate level of expected reciprocity, Q(2) = 12.81, p &lt; .01.</s><s>When expected reciprocity was at its maximum, the Kratio was irrelevant, Q(2) = 3.25, ns; when there were no expectations of reciprocity, a small but significant effect of payoff emerged, Q(2) = 4.21, p &lt; .02,</s><s>but it did not represent any meaningful order (i.e., that of the Kratio).</s></p><p><s>Together, the effects of expected reciprocity and the Kratio constituted the football-shaped pattern shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, the pattern of theoretical predictions displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  For intermediate expectations of reciprocity, the K ratio ought to make an all-or-none difference; the rate of cooperation should approach 100% for K= .83 and K= .50, and it should approach 0% for K= .17.</s><s>To account for the contraction of the empirical data relative to the strict theoretical model, we later sketch a descriptive judgment model that takes perceivers' biases and computational errors into account.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control conditions</head><p><s>There were three control conditions.</s><s>When participants were led to expect opponent cooperation or defection with certainty, or when they received no information, their own choices were not diagnostic of oppo-nent choices.</s><s>As expected, few participants cooperated when anticipating cooperation (7%) or when anticipating defection (5%).</s><s>When they had no information, they were more likely to cooperate (21%; z = 2.06, p = .04</s><s>for the comparison with the certain cooperation condition, and z = 4.44, p &lt; .001</s><s>for the comparison with the certain defection condition).</s><s>These differences emerged for each Kratio, Q(2) = 5.09, 6.63, and 20.18, all ps &lt; .05,</s><s>respectively, for the ratios of .17,</s><s>.5, and .83;</s><s>see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Unexpectedly, cooperation increased with the K ratio in the no-information condition, Q(2) = 14.63, p &lt; .001,</s><s>and in the certain cooperation condition, Q(2) = 8.44, p &lt; .01.</s><s>The K ratio was irrelevant only in the certain defection condition, Q(2) = 0.</s><s>These effects could be explained neither by game theory nor by the model of expected reciprocity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In support of our main hypothesis, cooperation rates rose sharply with increases in expectations of reciprocity.</s><s>When expectations were of intermediate strength, a high K ratio elicited the most cooperation.</s><s>A simple multiplicative model, combining the probability of reciprocity with the K ratio, predicted cooperation rates across conditions.</s><s>Across the nine experimental conditions, the differences between the expected values of cooperation and the expected values of defection were highly correlated with the rates of cooperation, r= .84,</s><s>p = .01.</s><s>By itself, the K ratio was a poor predictor of cooperation, r = .17,</s><s>p = .48.</s><s>Expected reciprocity thus appeared to be necessary for substantial cooperation to emerge.</s><s>Cooperation rates were low when no information about opponent behavior was given or when players were assured that they would encounter cooperation or defection.</s></p><p><s>The rate of 20% cooperation emerged as a baseline of choice under uncertainty.</s><s>This rate was observed when the probability of reciprocity was .5 and when no information was available about computer choice.</s><s>In this experiment, the no-information condition did not reflect the situation a player faces with a human opponent.</s><s>Social projection was disabled because whichever choice the player may have been contemplating, his or her processes of deliberation were not projectable to a computer.</s><s>Any simulation heuristic or theory of mind applicable to humans was of little value.</s><s>Relative to this baseline, cooperation was reduced when opponent choice was known.</s><s>However, even when cooperation was certain, some players cooperated, although they should have recognized the availability of a free ride.</s><s>Their failure to do so cannot be reconciled with game theory or with any theory assuming a generalized bent toward altruism.</s><s>The hypothesis of evidential reasoning suggests that choices in the PD are sensitive to expectations of reciprocity.</s><s>Participants need to generate their own expectations, and social projection is a mechanism by which they can do this.</s><s>Evidence for the alternative process of assimilation was weak.</s><s>Participants did not appear to align their choices with what they were led to expect from the opponent.</s><s>In the present design, it was not possible to compare projection and assimilation effects directly.</s><s>Projection was simulated by variations in the expectations of reciprocity, whereas assimilation was simulated by telling players what the opponent would do.</s><s>In Experiment 2 we varied the probability of opponent cooperation directly to facilitate comparisons across studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENT 2</head><p><s>In this experiment, players received the probability with which the opponent would cooperate.</s><s>This information made explicit the game theoretic assumption that the probability of cooperation is independent of the player's own contemplated choice.</s><s>Thus, this method ensured that players could not expect any systematic reciprocation of their choices.</s><s>Both game theory and the model of evidential reasoning predicted that rates of cooperation would be uniformly low.</s><s>In contrast, the assimilation hypothesis predicted that players would use the provided probability of cooperation as a cue toward their own decision to cooperate.</s><s>In Experiment 1, the K ratio of payoffs was modestly associated with the rate of cooperation when cooperation is certain.</s><s>We wanted to see whether this effect would replicate for varying probabilities of opponent cooperation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and design</head><p><s>The procedure was similar to that of Experiment 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>The assimilation hypothesis stated that cooperation would increase with the probability of opponent cooperation.</s><s>The findings, which are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, showed that this was not so.</s><s>Regardless of whether expectations of cooperation were low (p = .5,</s><s>21%), intermediate (p= .75,</s><s>29%), or high (p = 1, 20%), few players cooperated.</s><s>The difference between the low and the intermediate probability of opponent cooperation was not significant, z = 1.04, p = .19;</s><s>the difference between the intermediate and the high probability, though significant, z = 2.27, p = .01,</s><s>indicated a decrease rather than an increase in cooperation.</s><s>Across the three probability levels, cooperation did not vary significantly for K = .17,</s><s>Q(2) = .44.</s><s>For K= .5 and .83,</s><s>there was significant variation in the rate of cooperation, Q(2) = 6.42 and 6.07, both ps &lt; .05,</s><s>but there were no linear increases.</s></p><p><s>When the effect of the K ratio was examined, significant differences emerged when p(cooperation) = .5,</s><s>Q(2) = 21.00,</s><s>p &lt; .01,</s><s>and when p(cooperation) = .75,</s><s>Q(2) = 10.33,</s><s>p &lt; .01.</s><s>Only for the latter effect did levels of cooperation correspond to differences in the Kratio.</s><s>When cooperation was certain, there was no effect, Q(2) = 2.14, ns.</s><s>The results from the no-information condition replicated the results from Experiment 1.
