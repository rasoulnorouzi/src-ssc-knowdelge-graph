often unnecessary.</s><s>As a result, "people [have] become more able-physically, legally, linguistically, culturally and psychologically-to engage with each other wherever on earth they might be"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Generation</head><p><s>The collective action approach constitutes the theoretical framework for this study.</s><s>Public administration is viewed as a means for allocating decision-making capabilities in order to achieve collective action for the purpose of providing public goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ostrom and Ostrom 1971)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Ostrom (2010)</ref> identifies seven structural variables affecting participation in collective action.</s><s>Four variables do not depend on a repeated situation (number of participants, whether benefits are subtractive or fully shared, heterogeneity, and face-toface communication).</s><s>Three variables may be affected by repeated situations (information about past actions, link to society/country, enter/exit capability).</s><s>Our study asserts that the link to society/ country varies at the individual level and is manifested as ILG.</s></p><p><s>A key dimension of globalization-and the one that is perhaps most important for the current research-involves culture.</s><s>As Tomlinson puts it, "Globalization lies at the heart of modern culture; cultural practices lie at the heart of globalization" (1999, 1).</s><s>Culture, as conceived by Tomlinson, refers to all the ordinary practices that contribute to people's "life narratives" (20).</s><s>The cultural influence of globalization is multidirectional, creating a cultural fusion.</s></p><p><s>Intuitively, how globalization might influence individual behavior in relation to contributions to public goods is not difficult to imagine.</s><s>Traditionally, social norms and social capital were developed in groups formed by geographic proximity and by the sharing of features such as ethnicity and language <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bernhard, Fehr, and Fischbacher 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Habyarimana et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>As people internalize global culture, they may be likely to feel less in "partnership" with their fellow citizens <ref type="bibr">(Chong 2000, 48)</ref>.</s><s>That is, their reference group may shift from the nation-state to some broader cross-national grouping based on features other than language, ethnicity, and national boundaries-potentially influencing their willingness to contribute to local public goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keser and Van Winden 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We suggest that given the forces of globalization at work in today's world, an individual's approach to globalization is a key dispositional factor differentiating people's link to their society/country even within the same nation and culture.</s><s>At the individual level, we argue that globalism can be characterized along four dimensions: (1) self-perception as a world citizen; (2) individualism;</s></p><p><s>(3) consumerism; and (4) exposure to global mass media, communications, and culture.</s><s>These dimensions together compose an individual-level characteristic, ILG.</s><s>A higher ILG suggests a shift in the individual's reference group from the nation-state to some supranational grouping, as described earlier, sometimes accompanied by a feeling that one does not "belong" in terms of national affiliation-thus undermining the near-monopolistic position of the nation-state as the central locus of collective identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arnett 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Castles and Davidson 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Meyer et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Scholte 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Tomlinson 1999</ref>).</s><s>We further suggest that because of the comprehensive nature of ILG, even less-exposed individuals who rank high on the other dimensions of ILG (i.e., self-perception as a world citizen, individualism, and consumerism) will tend to contribute less to national and local public goods.</s></p><p><s>It is important to note that we do not ignore the potential role played by the extent to which a country is globalized in the decision to contribute to national public goods.</s><s>This research therefore incorporates a variable, country globalization level (CGL), that represents the degree to which a given nation is characterized by the economical, societal, and political markers of globalization.</s><s>We presume that in highly globalized countries, individual citizens are likely to have lower levels of nationalistic attitudes and affiliation to the society and state <ref type="bibr">(Norris and Inglehart 2009, 193-98)</ref>.</s><s>However, we argue that CGL is a fixed effect of the location that An individual's approach to globalization is a key dispositional factor diff erentiating people's link to their society/country even within the same nation and culture.</s></p><p><s>does not influence the relationship between ILG and the contribution to national and local public goods.</s><s>In other words, we presume that ILG, which manifests heterogeneity among the population and the link of the individual to the society/country <ref type="bibr">(Ostrom 2010)</ref>, will be related to the decision to contribute to public goods above and beyond the extent to which the country is globalized.</s></p><p><s>Thus, we hypothesize the following:</s></p><p><s>Hypothesis: The higher the ILG, the lower the individual's contribution to local public goods.</s></p></div>

target="#b21">(Denhardt and Denhardt 2015)</ref> and leaving the citizen in the shadow (in favor of the customer), it seems that at least some citizens were exposed to forces that shaped their perceptions regarding the state and their duties as a citizen.</s><s>From the findings of this research, we see not only that there is variation in the extent to which individual citizens are globalized but also that this variation has an impact on their willingness to contribute to local public goods.</s></p><p><s>The evidence we gathered supports our basic assumption that within any given society, individuals are likely to vary in their level of globalism.</s><s>This added dimension of heterogeneity can help us understand a number of contemporary political and societal processes.</s><s>Specifically, it is not only that individuals who live in countries with higher levels of globalization are less likely than citizens of less globalized nations to engage in behaviors that support the collective good.</s><s>Rather, we found that individuals who score higher on the globalism scale adopt a systematic behavior pattern in which they are significantly more likely to free-ride in public goods provision processes and significantly less likely to comply with tax laws or donate to local charities.</s><s>It should be noted that in our study, these effects of individual globalism were much alike for all four country samples.</s><s>These behaviors are thus a manifestation of the relationship between the citizen and society or the state as a bottom-up process, which may imply institutional changes.</s></p><p><s>Recent research has shown that inclusive social identification with the world community is related to an enhanced likelihood of contribution to a global public good <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buchan et al. 2011</ref>).</s><s>Our research findings may complement their findings in two main ways.</s><s>First, beyond identification with the world community, the ILG scale includes additional values such as individualism and consumerism that enable a broader perspective on globalization at the individual level.</s><s>Second, while the results show that higher identification is related to higher willingness to contribute to global public goods, our research shows that higher levels of ILG are related to a lower likelihood of contributing to local public goods.</s><s>Thus, our findings hint at a zero-sum game in which the willingness to contribute to a global cause may come at the expense of the willingness to contribute to a local cause.</s><s>Future research may want to combine both options in a single study.</s></p><p><s>Our research provides strong evidence that as people internalize the concept of an almost borderless world, and as they adopt the global culture of consumerism and individualism <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Pilkington and Johnson 2003)</ref>, they become less willing to make the contributions to local public goods that are a manifestation of the individual's commitment to the state and society.</s><s>The decline in substantive politics and societal values is perhaps not surprising in an era in which the New Public Management model of governance, which centers around the perception of citizens as "customers," encounters the globalized citizen whose self-perception is based on commitment to some amorphous, supranational grouping governed by the values of consumerism and individualism.</s></p><p><s>Our findings contribute to the public administration literature in a number of ways.</s><s>First, leaning on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Denhardt and Denhardt's (2015)</ref> notion of a new public service in which the focus is on public service (i.e., "rowing"), civic engagement, and democratic governance, the question regarding who is the citizen who should be served and engaged is critical.</s><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fung (2015)</ref>, increasing citizen participation may improve the provision of public goods.</s><s>However, there are challenges to citizen participation such as opportunistic and unsystematic leadership of participatory innovations and a quite limited tangibility of these participatory innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fung 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These challenges may correspond with the possible transformation in the affiliation and social identity of the more globalized individuals.</s><s>Our research takes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Denhardt and Denhardt's (2015)</ref> ideas and looks at them from another perspective-that is, what characterizes the citizen and not how he or she should be governed or serviced.</s><s>We claim that public administrators should understand who citizens are before they can understand what the best way of governance is.</s><s>We add the notion of ILG as characterizing citizens and influencing the extent to which they are willing to contribute to local public goods and suggest that ILG may be one such factor that must be taken into consideration when trying to decide which public services should be provided and how to administer them.</s><s>Moreover, our study emphasizes that, at least when it comes to ILG, people within the same nation vary, and this affects the extent to which they are willing to contribute to local public goods.</s><s>If the willingness to contribute to local public goods is related to the willingness to receive public goods (which must be explored in future studies) the question of the power of public administration for those who are willing to receive less services must be reopened and may create turmoil in our basic public administration theoretical foundations.</s><s>If some people contribute less and therefore expect less from Th e decline in substantive politics and societal values is perhaps not surprising in an era in which the New Public Management model of governance, which centers around the perception of citizens as " customers," encounters the globalized citizen.</s></p><p><s>their public goods provider, we may need to once again face the question of "what public administration should be doing."</s></p><p><s>Second, in view of the feasibility of exercising the "exit" option by citizens, our findings support concerns about the incapability of contemporary governments to "steer" their populations-that is, to be a central source for the "authoritative allocation of values" within society <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Peters and Pierre 1998)</ref>.</s><s>The "public value" discourse relates to "the unacknowledged collision between utilitarian and deontological views of government has created enormous confusion about what the public really wants from the government" <ref type="bibr">(Moore 2014, 472)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings may lead to the question of the meaning of creating "public value" for less connected or highly globalized individuals.</s></p><p><s>Empirically, this study responds to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Perry's (2012)</ref> call for research that integrates experimental methods into public administration research.</s><s>Finally, at the policy level, ILG may be a useful new explanatory tool for policy-related phenomena such as brain drain and the use of tax havens, in that it exemplifies the citizen's commitment to society/state and, consequently, his or her willingness to participate in collective action.</s><s>Future research may want to study the scale of the effect of ILG and the contribution to global public goods vis-à-vis local ones.</s><s>ILG also offers a contribution to the globalization literature, which has concentrated on the macro-level impacts of globalization.</s></p><p><s>These contributions should be seen in light of several theoretical and methodological limitations.</s><s>Because of budget constraints, we used a student sample, meaning that the sample may not be representative of the population as a whole.</s><s>However, as Alm (2010) points out, there is no reason to believe that the cognitive processes of students differ from those of other people.</s><s>Despite the possibility that using a student sample may cause smaller differences among the locations and may also attenuate the rate of donation in the NGO experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eckel and Grossman 1996)</ref>, the fact that we found support for our hypothesis despite this possible smaller variance in the dependent variable points to the strength of our findings.</s><s>Additionally, the fact that the research was conducted in only four countries could raise questions of generalizability and call for future research.</s><s>Similarly, future research may want to account for internal ethnical diversity and not only for external country/cultural level diversity.</s><s>As our operationalization was aimed at the local level, future research may wish to test similar effects also at the national level.</s></p><p><s>Finally, it is well recognized that experiments may not fully reflect individuals' behavior in real-world settings.</s><s>However, this method offers compensating advantages, specifically, in that the "experimental method permits cumulative empirical and theoretical progress through the rigorous testing of alternative theories, the establishment of causal relationships between key variables, and the replicability of results" <ref type="bibr">(Fehr and Gintis 2007, 44)</ref>.</s><s>To the extent that experimental results are applicable to real life, our research may thus serve as a departure point for future investigations of individual political behavior and may help us achieve a better understanding of developments in the nation-state in the era of globalization.</s></p></div>
