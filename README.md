# Project Title: Extracting Causal Sentences and Creating DAG for Social Science Papers

## Description
The main goal of this project is to develop a system that extracts causal sentences from social science papers and constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) over them. The DAG will help in visualizing the causal relationships between different variables and concepts discussed in the papers. The system will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, to identify and extract causal sentences. The extracted sentences will then be used to create a DAG, with nodes representing the variables or constructs discussed in the sentences and edges representing the relationships between them.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to contribute to the field of social science research by providing a tool to help researchers visualize and understand the causal relationships between different variables, derive testable hypotheses, and identify underlying phenomena. The DAG created by this system can serve as a
